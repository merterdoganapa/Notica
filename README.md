## Technical Implementation

The application demonstrates several key Android development concepts:

- **Foreground Service**: Implements `MusicPlayerService` for continuous playback
- **Custom Notifications**: Features a custom notification layout with media controls
- **Jetpack Compose UI**: Modern declarative UI with components like:
  - Dynamic playlist
  - Bottom player bar
  - Custom playback controls
- **State Management**: Handles playback state across service and UI
- **Media Player Integration**: Uses Android's MediaPlayer for audio playback

## Architecture

The app follows a clean architecture approach with these main components:

- `MainActivity`: Main UI container and service interaction
- `MusicPlayerService`: Handles background playback and notifications
- `Song`: Data model for music tracks
- Composable UI components:
  - `MusicPlayerApp`
  - `TopBar`
  - `SongItem`
  - `BottomPlayerBar`
